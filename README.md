## Insights deep dive

**Sales Trends**

- Overall Growth:
  
    * Between 2020 and 2024, total sales increased from $3.34 million to $6.25 million, representing an overall growth of approximately 87% across five years.
- Year-over-Year Breakdown:
  
    * 2020 → 2021: Slight increase of 1.3%, indicating stable but flat market activity post-launch
    * 2021 → 2022: Significant jump of 35.7%, suggesting expansion in customer base or higher-value product adoption
    * 2022 → 2023: Continued strong growth of 32.3%, maintaining momentum possibly due to strategic sales or new partnerships
    * 2023 → 2024: Growth slowed to 3.1%, implying market saturation or seasonal normalization after rapid scaling
- Trend Interpretation:
  
     * Sales show a clear upward linear trend with notable surges in 2022 and 2023, consistent with phases of business expansion. The slower growth in 2024 may indicate the need to explore new regions, products, or pricing strategies to sustain long-term performance.

**Product Performance**

- Top Five Products by Sales:
  
     * Top selling products include hospital beds, defibrillator, ECG machine, stethoscope, and surgical gloves.
     * Hospital beds account for nearly 38% of sales. With only 4000 units sold, this implies its a high priced item.
     * The top 5 products together contribute ~73% of total revenue, indicating a concentrated product portfolio.
- Order Volume:
  
     * Overall pattern: Total units sold each year fluctuate moderately with alternating growth and decline periods rather than consistent upward movement. 2022 stands out as the strongest year for both volume and sales — possibly due to strong market expansion or large institutional purchases.
     * Order volume shows cyclical variation — suggesting that increased sales have been driven more by higher unit prices or premium product mixes than by larger order counts
- Average Order Value(AOV)

**Customer Engagement**

- Membership Level Distribution:
     * Each membership tier has a similar number of customers (around 80–85 each). Gold members represent the highest engagement and sales volume because they're more active and higher-spending.
- Website Engagement:
     * Gold members average ~168 logins, which is higher than both bronze(52) and silver(88). This indicates a stronger online engagment leads to higher sales.
- Spending Behavior:
     * Gold members contribute around $8.3 billion in total spend which is more than double of silver and over 5 times bronze members. This sugguests that loyalty and engagement has a strong correlation with sales performance.
